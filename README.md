**#Big Data Heart Disease Prediction**

The idea behind this project was to learn how machine learning can be used, Logistic Regression in particular to detect if an individual is at risk of heart disease or not. By training the model on indicators like Blood Pressure, Cholesterol level etc, the model was tested on two sets of data. One dataset consisted of patients from US and one from patients belonging to Pakistan. The model was able to correctly predict patients with a heart condition with 90% accuracy.
